# Logic-Lab: Java Programming Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Logic-Lab** repository! This project is a collection of Java programs I’ve written while mastering core programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic logic.

The goal of this repo is to document my progress from basic syntax to complex problem-solving.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- **String Manipulation:** Reversal, Palindrome checks, and frequency counting.
- **Mathematical Logic:** Prime number detection, temperature conversion, and grade calculation.
- **Control Flow:** ATM simulations using Switch-Case and loops.
- **Array Operations:** Finding the second largest element and calculating sums.

## 💻 Key Programs

| File Name | Description | Concepts Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Q10_ATMSimulation.java` | A console-based ATM with deposit/withdraw features. | `while` loops, `switch-case` |
| `Q6_CheckPalindrome.java` | Checks if a string reads the same forward and backward. | `StringBuilder`, `String` methods |
| `PrimeOrNot.java` | Determines if an input integer is a prime number. | For-loops, `%` operator |
| `StringReverse.java` | Custom logic to reverse letters while keeping symbols in place. | Two-pointer technique |
| `secondLargest.java` | Finds the second highest value in an integer array. | Array traversal, conditional logic |
